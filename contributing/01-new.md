üôè Thanks **so much** for your interest in our community!
We know you're awesome just because you're interested, and we are thrilled to get the
opportunity to work with you.

We can't wait to see what you have to add, whether it's your opinions and feedback,
reporting issues, requesting features, participating in meetings, and/or submitting code
changes.


## First, please join our chat channel!

First, please [join us on Zulip!](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/471314-geojupyter).

This is the best place to communicate with other community members.

If you don't mind, please introduce yourself in our
[welcome thread](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/471314-geojupyter/topic/Welcome/with/503113120)!


## What project(s) are you interested in?

View our [Projects](../projects.md) page to see our community's works in progress.

Every project has its own documentation, and we strive to include a high-quality
contributor guide that will help you get up and running.
If you find any aspect of this documentation lacking, please don't hesitate to open an
issue on the respective GitHub repository, or to let us know directly on Zulip.
