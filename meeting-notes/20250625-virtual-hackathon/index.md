#### Breakout rooms

* Lobby: Symbology



### 💬 (10 minutes) Share out

Think about:
What exciting things did you accomplish?
What loose ends remain?
Big questions? Big ideas?

Please write for people who don’t have full context; link to related issues and documentation!

* Symbology
    * Plan to use [Vega Expressions](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/expressions/) instead of OpenLayers in the vectorlayer.json - open an issue for this!
    * Could use the descriptions around symbology information developed / described by [Sam (software engineer at DSE)](https://interactivedatascience.courses/) to inform how the schema is structured and / or described
        * Let Sam know his data visualization class slides are 404ing
    * Have some example project files bundled with the project and want to validate that they're obeying the schemas in CI - every time a PR is opened, want to make sure those aren't broken
    * Need to improve heatmap schema - maybe in the next PR
    * Think about the schema levels of abstraction -- should we extract symbology schemas into their own schema sub-directory instead of bundling them with the layers schemas? This will be especially important once we start discriminating between point, line, and polygon sub-types of vector layers because we'll have an explosion of schema possibilities and we'll want to drive the form generation more from the schema and less from the JavaScript.
    * How to do JSONSchema definitions and reference them _across files_?
    * Consider `creationform.tsx` -> `layerCreationForm.tsx`?
    * Next steps:
        * Create new form class that inherits from baseform, symbologyForm.
        * Move logic from symbologyDialog -> the new symbologyForm base component.
        * A starting point may be to use BaseForm in the SymbologyDialog module.
            * Look at creationform and debug/log to see what we pass to LayerForm on line 220 to better understand the implementation.
        * MAY need to register our schema in the formSchemaRegistry!
            * There's a `registerSchema` function, but it seems we never call it? Is it dynamically called in the generated code?
* TODO: Form property `syncData` -> `submitCallback`?
* TODO: Docs on schema -> TS/Py types generation
* Share out 2
