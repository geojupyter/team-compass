Post on Zulip to request a show & tell slot;
by default, QuantStack will demo awesome JupyterGIS progress each meeting!


### 💡 (5 minutes) What will we hack on?

* **What do you want to work on today**?
  * For ideas, check out the [hackathon](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/labels/hackathon)
    and [good first issue](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/labels/good%20first%20issue)
    labels on the JupyterGIS project!
* **Add your ideas to the “ideas” list below**.
* **Add your favorite emoji or a `+` next to ideas you’re excited about**.
  * Press the colon (:) key on your keyboard or navigate to “Insert > Emoji” in the menu bar to open the emoji browser.


#### Ideas

* More robustly defining the symbology schemas and generating those forms from the schemas (https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/754)
* Support vector layer sub-types (polygon, line, point)


### 🪄 (all the minutes) Hack together!

Form teams from the ideas generated in the step above!


#### Breakout rooms

None today, all together!


### 💬 (10 minutes) Share out

Think about:
What exciting things did you accomplish?
What loose ends remain?
Big questions? Big ideas?

Please write for people who don’t have full context; link to related issues and documentation!

* Separate the RJSF schema pre-processing (creating forms.json) into a separate NPM script
    * "forms.json is legacy code" -- from before we had a registry of json schemas. Now that we have a registry, we could get rid of it! Consider generating the schema registry from the source files, dereferencing on the fly if needed.
    * Matt will document this :)
* Vector sub-types: When adding a layer that has multiple types, create a group of layers instead of displaying a QGIS-ish dialog allowing the user to select from the available types. (Maybe we implement that later!)
