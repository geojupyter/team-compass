:mag: This meeting is _short_ and _task-focused_. Unfortunately, we won't have time to
introduce every new person to the team. Please attend core community meetings ([see
GeoJupyter calendar](https://geojupyter.org/calendar)) to meet the team and add your own
agenda items, and/or
[introduce yourself on Zulip](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/471314-geojupyter/topic/Welcome)!

Your name / GitHub ID / affiliation

* Matt / \@mfisher87 / Schmidt DSE
* Greg / \@gjmooney / QuantStack
* Martin / \@martinRenou / QuantStack
* Arjun / \@arjxn-py / QuantStack


## Status reports

* Martin: Not much coding news. Blog post is live! QuantStack slowing down (Arjun still on project).
* Arjun: Processing proof-of-concept. Initially using GDAL WASM under the hood. Create a buffer on vector layer. Building a form to let the user customize the operation.
    * https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/510
    * Reproducibility!
    * QGIS using GDAL under the hood
        * It sometimes provides the underlying GDAL commands in the processing GUI
        * Build a JSON schema for GDAL commands
        * This schema would generate Typescript & Python interfaces
        * This will help with form generation
        * Could also enable generation of Python code (GDAL Python bindings)

* Status


## Requests for help

* In-person hackathon & QuantStack participation
    * Continue discussion on Zulip!
* Funding more QuantStack work
    * QuantStack definitely interested.
