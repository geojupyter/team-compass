## Hack teams

For ideas, check out the [hackathon](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/labels/hackathon) and [good first issue](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/labels/good%20first%20issue) labels on the JupyterGIS project!

Join the corresponding breakout room to hack!

**Lobby**: Orientation! Help setting up dev environment, etc. Docs: https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributor_guide/index.html
* Kristin

1. Dockerize! (https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/267)
    * Matt & Sanjay
    * https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis-docker
    * Martin: Could a GHA bot run every day and check for a new release? Should it work like the conda forge bot where it opens a PR, we review, and merge. Or just have the bot commit and tag? (the latter seems preferred)
        * Arjun: Put dockerfile in JGIS repository in `scripts/` directory?
        *
2. Python API improvements (https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/436)
    * Brookie, Martin, Arjun, Yao-Ting, Greg & Qiusheng
    * Walked through workflows.
      Brookie will clean up notes and put on GitHub as a comment to the issue: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/436
      Also start a chat on Zulip!

#### More

3. Layer show/hide button gets pushed off the panel (https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/244)
4. Improve layer gallery contributor experience (https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/277)
    * Martin: The gallery is generated from xyzservices Python package. How's the contributor experience for this package?
    * https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/blob/b5cdceb81d316efe9dd520671a626cc533108e7f/packages/base/rasterlayer_gallery_generator.py#L9


## Share out

Think about:
What exciting things did you accomplish?
What loose ends remain?
Big questions? Big ideas?

* Add `add_vector_layer` function to Python API: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/445
* New ideas for bi-directional interactions with documents, layers, features between JGIS and Notebook. e.g. get vector and raster layers from the doc, and use a vector feature to select raster pixels, mean them, then update the vector with a new attribute containing the result of the mean operation: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/436#issuecomment-2637601373
* Docker!
  * Source: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis-docker
  * Image: `ghcr.io/geojupyter/jupytergis:latest`
  * Docs PR: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/446


## Notes

* Brookie: `object = doc.get_feature(layer=..., feature_id=...)` to grab a unique feature out of a layer or `object = doc.get_selected_features()`
    * Sanjay: We wanted this on lonboard. Ipyleaflet has this maybe? Ability to draw a bounding box or shape, then `doc.get_bbox()` or `doc.get_features_in_bbox()`.
    * Brookie:
* Brookie: Sort collaborators alphabetically
