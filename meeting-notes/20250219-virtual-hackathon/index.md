**Lobby**: Orientation.+JM

1. Continue brainstorming Python API improvements with a focus on reproducibility (https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/436) +YT
2. Converting project documentation from reST to MyST (Kristin was assigned this task on GitHub =D)


### Not today

3. Consider how to implement workflows for manually & collaboratively building a vector dataset representing personal knowledge/observations (https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/395)


## Share out

Think about:
What exciting things did you accomplish?
What loose ends remain?
Big questions? Big ideas?

* Implemented remove layer method: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/478
* A `dev container` approach to avoid issues with WSL / Windows / OSX issues - but how does this interact with the JupyterLab workflow??
    * https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/blob/main/script-library/docs/jupyterlab.md
* Thinking about Python API and reproducibility.
    * What about "recording" a manifest of actions taken in the GUI and generating Python code? Suggested by Nick :) How will this work? :thinking_face:
* Converted `troubleshooting.rst` to .md! [PR here](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/479)
    * Will reviewers assign themselves to PRs or should PR-makers assign them before posting the PR?
* We should simplify the documentation building setup to optionally build jupyterlite
    * Could we push jupyterlite builds to an artifact registry to speed up CI/CD?
* Martin walked Jon through setting up a JupyterGIS Dev Environment and everything worked first try! :confetti_ball:
* Still a few more files to convert to MyST, but the process is straightforward with `rst2myst`
    * Kristin will (try) to convert one more doc from .rst to .md before next hackathon
* I've put QuantStack's internal git guidelines in public here <https://github.com/martinRenou/git_tutorial/blob/main/git/git_workflow.md> for those interested :raised_hands:
