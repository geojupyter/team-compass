## Status reports

* Matt: CNG went well! Prepping for a workshop next week, won't be doing much dev.
* Arjun:
    * Settings PR: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/619
    * Schema version PR: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/590
        * Should the field be under "metadata" or at the root?
        * ipynb has "nbformat" and "nbformat_minor" both at the root.
            * Notebook metadata has information about the kernel, that's it.
            * Maybe JGIS projects have "author", "last_edited" as metadata. What else?
            * What about viewport location? Currently in `options`, which we think makes sense. That's the project _data_.
            * **Decision**: Keep `schema_version` at the root!
        * What about annotations? Should they be metadata or top-level?
            * Matt/Greg: Gut says top-level, but we can leave as-is for now.
    * Annotation UX improvements: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/650 , https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/640
* David:
    * TiTiler extension: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis-tiler
        * Serve zarr file https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis-tiler/blob/main/examples/xarray.ipynb
        * Does this enable collaboration on a Xarray DataArray?
            * Depends. if the Kernel is shared by everyone, it should work!
            * If JupyterLite, no go.
        * Adds new dependency, makes the doc a bit more complex.
        * Not sure whether this belongs in core yet. David feels strongly not to! Martin feels adding to core could be nice.
        * Serve non-optimized GeoTIFFs from kernel.
