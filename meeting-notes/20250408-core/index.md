### New agenda items

- [ ] AGU2025
  - Planning on a session and a workshop
  - Session: Full day, posters in morning, oral in afternoon.
  - Workshop: 3.5 hours or 7 hours. Not GeoJupyter specific; open source and cloud native tools.
- EGU in May 2025, anyone in QuantStack going? **Ask in Zulip.**
- [ ] GeoJupyter Focus Group @ Berkeley campus
  - Super productive!
  - Insights:
    - :x: "No metadata" still very common problem.
      - We can make our interface more usable than QGIS', take inspiration from epsg.io for example.
    - :confounded: Too many data formats!
      - :sob: "I feel despair when opening a NetCDF"
    - :left_speech_bubble: "I want my actions in an interface to produce a script to be reproducible."
    - :video_game: I want to do it multiplayer.
    - :sparkles: "Too much prep work before I can even visualize my input data."
    - :chart_with_upwards_trend: Lots of R users.
      - :medal: "My favorite tool is R|ggplot|GEE|StoryMaps"
- [ ] Progress on a new dance called :dancer: "The JupyterGIS bounce" :dancer:
  - :heart: Awesome work Arjun, Martin, Nicolas!
  - Would love your review on WIP [blog post](https://github.com/geojupyter/geojupyter.org/pull/64)
  - PRs:
    - :wrench: [WIP: Add new function `geo_debug(my_data)`](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/340) - opens a JGIS panel (new document) to explore `my_data` (including a basemap).
      - Better name for this function? Proposed:
        - `show()` - could be confused with other `show()` functions which open a widget to simply display an object; this function will create a new document and pre-populate it with a layer
        - Nicolas: `sandbox()` `playground()`
        - Fernando: `geo_explore()`, `explore()`
      - Update path for widget:
          - Filepath passed to model is only informative.
          - sharedModel, not model, is the thing that shares data with the server.
          - No way to update the file target, it's a read-only property.
          - Better to create a new widget and replace.
          - Nicolas: Maybe we shouldn't do this; re-running the notebook would replace the widget again
          - Fernando: It's important that certain patterns of behavior are consistent across Jupyter components. Notebooks are documents, consoles are throwaway environments. Notebooks always live on disk, but if not named have a name slug.
            - Nicolas: What about a file naming convention to indicate that this is a temporary file?
            - Fernando: Untitled1.jGIS!
    - :wrench: [WIP: Add "Save as..." to UI](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/594)
    - :heavy_check_mark: [Add "Save as..." to Python API](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/593)
    - :heavy_check_mark: [Display toolbar in widget/sidecar views](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/397)
- [ ] GeoJupyter architecture documentation and contributor tutorials
  - :heart: Awesome work Sanjay, Arjun, Martin!
  - :index_pointing_at_the_viewer: Could use your help!
  - [Architecture docs first draft](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/576)
  - [Contributor tutorial - add keybindings](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/586)
  - In progress contributor tutorial - add new command (no PR yet)
