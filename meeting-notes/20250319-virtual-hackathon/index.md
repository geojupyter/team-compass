3. Other "good first issue" ++
4. Pangeo prep ++

* UX issues:


### Ideas

* Prep for pangeo showcase presentation (which will be immediately after the hackathon, please join if you want :smile: https://numfocus-org.zoom.us/j/83234473026?pwd=mgM3uAuru1AE1aFPlRjW2dAAAyo8IY.1)

* Annotations as a dataset / create vector data: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/395

* Attribute table

* Python API enhancements: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/436

* Re-implement "QGIS bounce" workflow in JGIS: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/513

* Brainstorm mechanisms for reproducible analysis when moving between point-and-click and notebook environments: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/436#issuecomment-2637601373

* Continue evolving a reproducible "processing toolbox" model: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/519


## Share out

Think about:
What exciting things did you accomplish?
What loose ends remain?
Big questions? Big ideas?

* Buffer units:
    * https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/554
    * Decided that we would disallow the user to reproject (WIP - still need to update `command.ts`)
    * Added a custom form for buffering, doesn't quite work yet. We don't yet know how to get the projection from the source layer in the form context because we'd have to ask OpenLayers.
    * Matt will push in 1 hour
* Documentation for building documentation:
    * Created requirements-docs.md and will create PR draft
        * Use `docs/environment-docs.yml` instead (`micromamba env create -f docs/environment-docs.yml`)
    * Discussed one-click docs build -- for later! For now, let's just document the process.
    * Yao-Ting will push later today!
* Martin opened PR for disabling identify tool: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/553
