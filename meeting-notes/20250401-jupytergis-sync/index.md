## Status reports

* Matt & Arjun: "Save as..." https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/582
* Arjun:
    * Restored local GeoTIFFs!
    * Modular processing logic - SQL query focused
    * Saving processing outputs as separate files instead of embedding in JGIS project.
      * Martin: How about making it optional to embed the processed data in jgis? With a checkbox in the processing form?
    * Streamlining docs build -- 1 conda environment
    * Reprojection command
* Matt: `geo_debug` function

## Requests for help

* Want to implement "Save as..." in the Python API & UI.
  How to share functionality / call between Python & JS?
  * Save as JGIS & Save as QGIS could be in same UI menu.
  * Write separate JS and Python implementations
  * In JS implementation, "Save as..." should rename (implemented in documentmanager) the existing document, and create a copy with the old name.

## Misc

* Package JGIS data files with project data in a tar file? [Can untar in JS](https://github.com/emscripten-forge/untarjs)!
