## Hack teams

For ideas, check out the [hackathon](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/labels/hackathon) and [good first issue](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/labels/good%20first%20issue) labels on the JupyterGIS project!

Join the corresponding breakout room to hack!

1. Add to / improve architecture documentation: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/576. (Martin, Sanjay, Kristin)
    * Review PR
    * Keep in mind that code gets outdated quickly, and thus documentation of it can as well. Can make descriptions in the documentation more high-level so we can avoid documentation getting out-of-date quickly.
2. Remove Source Panel https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/435 :+1: (Martin) :+1: (Arjun) - https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/671
3. Simplify Symbology Panel - https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/469 :+1: (Arjun; Martin & Kristin joined later in the hackathon)

Didn't work on today:

* Make Python package builds more self-contained: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/585
    i) Try implementing dev environment with `pixi`?
* Annotations as a dataset / create vector data: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/395
* Continue evolving a reproducible "processing toolbox" model: https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/519



## Share out

Think about:
What exciting things did you accomplish?
What loose ends remain?
Big questions? Big ideas?

* Simplify Symbology Panel - https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/469
    * Need to keep discussing this
    * Perhaps could use a style function? See example from [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/geojson.html)
    * Bring Greg into the conversation
        * He has an example of a style function in `mainView.tsx`
            * The style applies to everything - doesn't look for the layer type
    * Maybe remove [SimpleSymbol.tsx](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/blob/2669fad2d0c088a9718a360b267586935a65f862/packages/base/src/dialogs/symbology/vector_layer/types/SimpleSymbol.tsx), and define all prefixes (lines 94 - 98) for all different types
    * Perhaps need to change `circle-fill-color` argument to something more generic, like `color-`, and then have a way for the software to know how to apply that to different geometry types
* Arjun removed the source panel! Still has to remove some related styles - https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/671
* Martin, Sanjay, Kristin worked on architecture documentation and completed a revised draft - https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/576
