## Share out

Think about:
What exciting things did you accomplish?
What loose ends remain?
Big questions? Big ideas?

* File dialog scrunches / truncates file names
    * The file dialog comes from `@jupyterlab/filebrowser`
    * It's the same as the file browser on the left panel
        * The file browser on the left panel works perfectly!
    * We're just using in a different context to display it as a modal
        * Maybe the context is the problem, and the file browser in the left panel depends on some CSS from a parent element to look correct?
        *
    * Reproduction is inconsistent :exploding_head: :melting_face:
        * Some people/browsers see ellipses, some people don't
            * Sanjay sees ellipses in Firefox, no ellipses in Chrome
        * Some people see truncation, some people don't
            * It doesn't seem like truncation depends on the browser
        * It seems to have nothing to do with browser model or browser version
            * Matt (Ubuntu) was using Firefox 137, and it reproduced
            * Kristin (Mac) was using Firefox 138, and it did not reproduce
            * Matt upgraded to Firefox 138, and it did reproduce
            * Martin (Fedora) was using latest Firefox, and it did not reproduce
            * Sanjay (Mac) reproduced in Chrome & Firefox 137
            * Arjun (Mac) was using Chrome, unable to reproduce fully
                * Decreasing width of the file browser hides modified dates
                * But the filenames never get scrunched
            * Felipe (Mac) was using Safari & Firefox, and it reproduced
    * Fiddling around with styles sometimes helps, but hasn't yet yielded a full solution where the dialog works exactly like the file browser in the left panel.
        * TODO: Sanjay to fill out some of the things he's tried!
    * DID SANJAY ('s drunk AI companion) FIX IT ?!?!?!?!?!
        * How? ... TODO ...
            * Sanjay modified packages/base/source/style/dialog.css
                * In the main branch, there's basically nothing in that file

* Were able to fix :tada::
    * Symbology panel: color steps are not recovered properly after setting graduated radius - https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/694 with https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/700
