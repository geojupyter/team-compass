* Divergent color ramps:
    * Improve CSS for displaying disabled min/max input fields
    * Improve label of "Use actual range" button -- include the data min/max in the label! Thanks, Yao-Ting!
    * Minor refactors for readability (extract named boolean, leave props packed in object called `props`)
    * Only render min/max controls for graduated & singleband symbology modes
    * Fixup critical value display to use selected min/max, remove hardcode
    * WIP: Fixup saving/loading min/max/reverse from the shared model. Previously, these values were only "saved" in the downstream classified color stops, and when re-opening the UI they'd reset to default. Now, they save into the shared document, but they don't successfully load from the shared document (yet!). Pushed a WIP commit.
