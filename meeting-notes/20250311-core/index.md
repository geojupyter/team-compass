### New agenda items

- [ ] :computer: Virtual hackathons: continue to be successful at bringing in new community members and focusing energy.
    - :hammer_and_wrench: Big topic of discussion right now: [Reproducible processing toolbox](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/519)!
    -
    -
- [ ] :money_mouth_face: Looking for funding opportunities! What are you aware of?
    - NSF GEO OSE Track 2, due November. High effort.
    -
    -
- [ ] :wrench: Processing toolbox
    - Export to shapefile?
        - http://switchfromshapefile.org/
        - Brookie: Shapefiles ubiquitous. It might be a mistake not to support them!
        - We could deprioritize shapefiles?
        - Could point to an online converter tool until we support shapefile export
    - POC has been merged https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/510 :tada:
    - Support other units: User enters e.g. meters, convert to degrees, pass to GDAL in native projection units.
        - Spatialite supports unit conversion, but doesn't seem to be geospatially aware: <https://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/spatialite-sql-5.1.0.html#length_cvt>
        - <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62514871/how-to-change-buffer-size-from-degrees-to-distance-by-meters-in-postgis>
- [ ] Layer export: <https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/pull/528>
    - Warn users when converting vector data to raster (lossy). Hover-over :warning: icon?
    - Move format-changing operation into processing toolbox and only support exporting vector as vector and raster as raster?
