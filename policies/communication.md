## Technology

We use the following communication technologies:

* For synchronous text communication:
  * [Zulip](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com)
* For asynchronous text communication:
  * GitHub issues and pull requests
* For video/audio communication:
  * Zoom
  * Google Meet
* For scheduling:
  * Google Calendar (see the
    [GeoJupyter community calendar](https://geojupyter.org/calendar))
* For prioritization:
  * [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/geojupyter/projects)


## Quality

To communicate with higher quality, we suggest the following methods:

* As the communicator, take on additional communication burden to reduce the effort
  required for the listener or reader.
  * Screenshots or video screen captures are far more effective than words for
    demonstrating a technical feature or issue.
* Follow the [Project Jupyter Code of Conduct](https://jupyter.org/governance/conduct/code_of_conduct.html)!
