title: "Decision-making process"
---

We follow the process defined in the
[Project Jupyter decision-making guide](https://jupyter.org/governance/decision_making.html).

Specifically, we value consensus-based decision-making, but acknowledge that may not
always be possible, and fall back to voting in those cases.

Proposers should proactively seek consensus through discussion.
Proposers should use
[active listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening) to _ensure_ that
they understand the community before acting on their understanding.
