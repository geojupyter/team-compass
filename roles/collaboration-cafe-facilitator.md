title: "Collaboration Café Facilitator"
---

A Collaboration Café is a (usually virtual) event that brings together community members
for collaboration on technical, social, design, ideation, or other tasks.

A GeoJupyter _Collaboration Café Facilitator_ helps... facilitate Collaboration Cafés!
There's no better way to say that 😉

A _Collaboration Café Facilitator_ might perform any of the following tasks:

* Welcoming hackathon participants and new community members
* Gathering inputs from participants about what they want to hack on
* Organizing participants' ideas into a reasonable number of tasks
* Forming small teams in breakout rooms
* Keeping the group updated on time constraints
* Run automations to create and sync notetaking documents
* Take notes
* Contribute to our [Hackathon facilitation guide](https://geojupyter.org/handbook/hackathon-facilitation.html)
