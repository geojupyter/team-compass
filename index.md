## ‚ÅâÔ∏è What's a "team compass" about?

**A team compass is a place for community members, new and old, to align on objectives,
practices, and happenings.**

For example, you can find:

* [Team members](team/index.md) (TODO)
* [Recognition and celebrations](team/recognition.md) (TODO)
* Meeting notes (TODO; for now, look
  [here](https://geojupyter.org/blog/#category=Meeting%20notes))
* [Coding practices](policies/coding.md) (TODO)
* [Communication practices](policies/communication.md)


## üìë Code of conduct

The [GeoJupyter](https://geojupyter.org) community uses the
[Jupyter Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/main/conduct/code_of_conduct.md).
